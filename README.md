html5 canvas graphs and charts

Hi there,

with this project i have tried to create a jquery plugin for graphs that are rendered using canvas component provided as a part of html5.

this project is so far tried and tested in google chrome only.

to be implemented:
-------------------

support for text data on x-axis (both point graph and trend graph)

support for direct table conversion to graph

multi- quadrant support.
